# Homework Challenge
## I tried to run the docker on my own environment
I managed to get the containers working by installing docker desktop on my University PC
Then i followed along the started tutorial to get a better idea of running containers
https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

Next i tried running each container individually (backend and frontend) which they work!
![Individual Containers Working](assets/individual_containers_working_week2.png)<br />

But somehow, they don't seem to be able to communicate with each other.
The Posts on the home page is not shown at all.
Furthermore, when i used docker compose up to launch the containers together. The frontend doesn't work.

This is my docker-compose.yml file.

So my I am troubleshooting it right now.
As a reference i read the article about docker networking introduced. Which really helped me. But i am not still be able to solve the problem. I'll try to work it out this weekend. then maybe i'll try the QA discord
